<strong><font size="5">How to get started in Naranpur</font></strong>:

<br><br><br>

Use the map on the <strong>World</strong> page to go to your farms (highlighted on the ownership map in green), 
where you can make key management decisions about crop production, animal care, and water collection.  The world 
page will allow you to see an overview of conditions within the watershed and give you some idea of how well you 
are doing versus other families in the region.  

<br><br><br>

The <strong>Family</strong> menu will let you access your <strong>Inventory</strong> to give 
you a detailed overview of the resources you have available. This menu will also let you access the 
<strong>Needs list</strong>, 
which will give you a concise summary of key limiting resources needed within the game (e.g., labor, water, and food).
Notification of critical events occurring in the game will also be posted under this menu as 
<strong>Alerts</strong>.

Buy and sell resources at a fixed price at the 
<strong>Store</strong>
or barter with other villagers for better deals at the 
<strong>Market</strong>. Share your concerns or suggestions with your community in the public Forum or privately 
scheme with other families using 
<strong>Messages</strong>.

<strong>Admin</strong> menu.
